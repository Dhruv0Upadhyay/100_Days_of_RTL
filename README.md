# [100 Days Of RTL Challenge](https://github.com/Dhruv0Upadhyay/100_Days_of_RTL)
I recently started learning Verilog and SystemVerilog. So, what's better was to improve the designing of circuits using these languages. This is a personal challenge where for the next 100 days, I'll be practicing and posting 100 different circuits. This challenge will enhance my concepts of _Digital Electronic Circuits & Hardware Descriptive Languages_.
Also during the process, I'll try to share some knowledge gained and insights in form of blogs, so do connect with me on LinkedIn.

# How To Access Repository
For each day, there will be a separate folder containing the design and testbench followed by a Readme file giving a detail explanation of the working of the circuit.
